# NHM_Factory
This tool is used to generate the base of the no-hats-addon.
You can clone these repos with the links found in the root [README](README.md) of this branch
[README.md](/README.md)
 You will have to compile them yourself.

## Usage
To generate the base version, simply run "genall.sh". Fill in the necessary prompts asked in the terminal. If possible, avoid file paths that utilize symbolic/hard links.

## Disclaimer
Do these scripts work? On my end, yes, on yours, I have no idea. Are they safe? Who knows? Read 'em up, see how they work!
