err: an output directory must have this structure:
<output>
├── 0kb_files
└── uncompiled
      ├── demo
      │     ├── animation (a file containing rules that will be in every generated QC file)
      │     └── (files whose content will only be included if called by name)
      ├── engineer
      └── (and all the other classes)
