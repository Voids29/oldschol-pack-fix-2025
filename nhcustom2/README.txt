--README--

To use this program, you HAVE to download an up to date
database. You can find it at <https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/database.csv>.
Simply place it in the same folder as the executable.

You also HAVE to place a decompiled version of the no-hats-mod
of your choice in the input folder.

nhcustom's output is "complied" folder in previous directory (../complied)

I highly encourage you to go read the documentation at
<https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/>. The one shipped with the
program is painfully out of date.

If the links are dead, you know who to blame (me).
