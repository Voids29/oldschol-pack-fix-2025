# NHCustom2
If you have modeled a new hat and wish to exclude it from being replaced/removed, this tool is for you!
This tool takes base of nohatsbgum generated by nhm_factory, and allows the user to specifiy which cosmetics to remove/keep.

## Usage
This version of the tool only works on Linux. If you are Windows user, I recommend looking into WSL to utilize this tool and the others in this branch.
To use this program, you HAVE to download an up to date database. You can find it at https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/database.csv
Simply place it in the same folder as the executable (nhcustom2).

### Database Generation
You can also generate a database locally using NHSchema. Read the [documentation](/.documentation_backup/NHSchema_README.md) to learn how.

### Config.txt
For editing the "config.txt" file, I highly encourage you to go read the documentation at:
- [NHCustom2](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2)
- [config.txt examples](https://pevhs.ch/tf2/nhcustom2/config_example)

If these two links are down, I have made a local copies in the in this repository under "/.documentation_backup".
- [config.txt examples(browser view)](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Voids29/oldschool-pack-fix-2025/blob/no-hats-addon/.documentation_backup/config_example.txt.html)
- [config.txt examples](/.documentation_backup/config_example.txt.html)
- [NHCustom2(browser view)](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Voids29/oldschool-pack-fix-2025/blob/no-hats-addon/.documentation_backup/nhcustom2.html)
- [NHCustom2](/.documentation_backup/nhcustom2.html)

Once you have the config.txt configured to your liking, execute nhcustom2.sh. A modified copy of the raw compiled nohatsbgum should appear in the "output" directory with the applied configuration you sepcified in config.txt.
This modified copy can either be merged with the main branch locally, or be packaged into a .vpk file with 3rd party tools or Valve's "vpk.exe".
